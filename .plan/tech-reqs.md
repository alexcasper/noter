# Technical Requirements

This document outlines the technical requirements for the task and reading list management tool.

## 1. Simplenote Integration

- **Authentication:** The application must securely authenticate with the Simplenote API using user-provided credentials.
- **API Wrapper:** A dedicated module or class will be created to wrap the Simplenote API. This will handle all API requests and responses.
- **Note Retrieval:** The application will fetch all notes from the user's Simplenote account.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API requests, including network errors, authentication failures, and rate limiting.

## 2. Firestore Backup

- **Firebase Project:** A Firebase project with Firestore enabled is required.
- **Authentication:** The application will use a Firebase service account to authenticate with the Firestore API.
- **Data Model:** All notes will be stored in a single Firestore document. The document will contain a collection of notes, where each note is a map or object with its content and metadata.
- **Backup Service:** A service will be created to handle the backup process. This service will retrieve notes from the Simplenote wrapper and write them to Firestore.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Determine a strategy for handling conflicts if the same note is modified in both Simplenote and Firestore. For this version, the Simplenote version will be considered the source of truth.

## 3. Note Viewing

- **Web Interface:** A web-based interface will be created to display the notes stored in Firestore.
- **Frontend Framework:** A simple frontend will be built using a suitable framework (e.g., Flask, or a simple HTML/CSS/JS stack).
- **Note Display:** The interface will list all the notes and allow the user to view the content of a selected note.

## 4. Note Enrichment with Gemini

- **Google AI API:** The application will integrate with the Google AI (Gemini) API.
- **Link Extraction:** A mechanism will be implemented to extract links from the content of the notes.
- **Web Content Retrieval:** The application will fetch the content of the extracted links.
- **Summarization:** The retrieved content will be sent to the Gemini API to generate a concise summary.
- **Enriched Note Display:** The generated summary will be displayed alongside the original note in the web interface.
- **API Key Management:** The Gemini API key will be stored securely.
