This is a tool to help me manage my tasks and reading list.
- It should interact with the Simplenote API to pull in notes.
- It should back up notes to Firestore - ideally all notes should be in a single document
- It should allow me to view my notes (from firestore)
- It should be able to enrich notes by accessing links and retrieving content, producing a short summary using Gemini
